You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N. Where N is equal to [2M + 1].

Now, in the given array/list, 'M' numbers are present twice and one number is present only once.

You need to find and return that number which is unique in the array/list.

 Note:
Unique element is always present in the array/list according to the given condition.

solution====:::;

int findUnique(int *arr, int size)
{
    int ans=0;

    for(int i=0; i<size; i++){
        ans=ans^arr[i];
    }
    return ans;
    
}

/////Problem statement

You are given an array ‘ARR’ of size ‘N’ containing each number between 1 and ‘N’ - 1 at least once. There is a single integer value that is present in the array twice. Your task is to find the duplicate integer value present in the array.

For example:

Consider ARR = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4], the duplicate integer value present in the array is 4. Hence, the answer is 4 in this case.
Note :
A duplicate number is always present in the given array.


//Problem statement


You are given an array/list ARR consisting of N integers. Your task is to find all the distinct triplets present in the array which adds up to a given number K.

An array is said to have a triplet {ARR[i], ARR[j], ARR[k]} with sum = 'K' if there exists three indices i, j and k such that i!=j, j!=k and i!=j and ARR[i] + ARR[j] + ARR[k] = 'K'.

Note:
1. You can return the list of values in any order. For example, if a valid triplet is {1, 2, -3}, then {2, -3, 1}, {-3, 2, 1} etc is also valid triplet. Also, the ordering of different triplets can be random i.e if there are more than one valid triplets, you can return them in any order.
2. The elements in the array need not be distinct.
3. If no such triplet is present in the array, then return an empty list, and the output printed for such a test case will be "-1".
